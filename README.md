Note: Initial compilation build and simple excecution tests will run in about 5 mins. The validation tests will take longer with results being updated to the webpage when finished.

If tests are passed fields become green with the excecution time displayed (logs can be retrived form the text link)
If tests failed fields will be red for physics tests validation plots can be accessed from the link with. Non matching plots will be shown with the text "Error!!!" and the stars indication the expected value and the lines the submission results.
If feilds have text similar to "uwr89yh32hrhh3903heText2" then those tests are currently uncomplete
